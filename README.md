Uploaded data and project sources used in the article "The Effect of Patent Acquisition on Subsequent Patenting Activity" published in the World Patent Information Journal. </br>
This model concerns understanding the patenting activities of patent buyers after acquisition. By merging patent bibliographies and patent assignment information, the original dataset was prepared to investigate the patent acquisition activities of the patentees who were granted patents and their patent application activities. Observing a competitorâ€™s patent acquisition activities gives insights into the future direction of its technology development.
